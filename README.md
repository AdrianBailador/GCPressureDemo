# GCPressure

A simple .NET benchmark comparing regular array allocation with `ArrayPool<T>` to demonstrate how to reduce garbage collector (GC) pressure.

## ðŸ§ª Benchmarks

Using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/), this project shows how pooled memory can reduce allocations and improve performance in high-throughput scenarios.

## ðŸ”§ Run it

```bash
dotnet run -c Release
